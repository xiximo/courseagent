I've been creating dashboard UIs at work and for my personal projects. I always wanted to make a reusable collection of dashboard UI for future projects; and here it is now. While I've created a few custom components, some of the code is directly adapted from ShadcnUI examples.

> This is not a starter project (template) though. I'll probably make one in the future.

## Features

- Light/dark mode
- Responsive
- Accessible
- With built-in Sidebar component
- Global search command
- 10+ pages
- Extra custom components
- RTL support

<details>
<summary>Customized Components (click to expand)</summary>

This project uses Shadcn UI components, but some have been slightly modified for better RTL (Right-to-Left) support and other improvements. These customized components differ from the original Shadcn UI versions.

If you want to update components using the Shadcn CLI (e.g., `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`), it's generally safe for non-customized components. For the listed customized ones, you may need to manually merge changes to preserve the project's modifications and avoid overwriting RTL support or other updates.

> If you don't require RTL support, you can safely update the 'RTL Updated Components' via the Shadcn CLI, as these changes are primarily for RTL compatibility. The 'Modified Components' may have other customizations to consider.

### Modified Components

- scroll-area
- sonner
- separator

### RTL Updated Components

- alert-dialog
- calendar
- command
- dialog
- dropdown-menu
- select
- table
- sheet
- sidebar
- switch

**Notes:**

- **Modified Components**: These have general updates, potentially including RTL adjustments.
- **RTL Updated Components**: These have specific changes for RTL language support (e.g., layout, positioning).
- For implementation details, check the source files in `src/components/ui/`.
- All other Shadcn UI components in the project are standard and can be safely updated via the CLI.

## 企标审核前端（webadmin）

基于 PRD 与 Hermes 架构方案实现的 Mock 前端，默认登录后进入 `/qa`。

| 路由 | 页面 |
|------|------|
| `/qa` | 标准知识问答 |
| `/standards` | 标准检索 |
| `/standards/:id` | 标准详情 |
| `/review-assist` | 审核辅助 |
| `/sync` | 标准更新（SPRS 同步任务） |
| `/admin/qibiao-settings` | 系统配置 |
| `/admin/agent` | Agent 运维总览 |
| `/admin/agent/profiles` | Profile 配置 |
| `/admin/agent/orchestration` | 编排参数（仅系统管理员可写） |
| `/admin/agent/tools` | Tool Registry |
| `/admin/agent/toolsets` | 角色 Toolset 矩阵 |
| `/admin/agent/skills` | Skills 版本管理 |
| `/admin/agent/models` | 模型与 Fast Path 路由 |
| `/admin/agent/sessions` | 会话轨迹审计 |

开发 Mock 开关：`.env.development` 中 `VITE_QIBIAO_MOCK=true`。Mock 模式下顶栏可切换「演示角色」以验证权限菜单（标准管理员对运维台只读，无编排/模型菜单）。

```bash
cd webadmin
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
